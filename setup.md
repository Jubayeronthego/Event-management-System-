# Quick Setup Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

Your MERN stack environment is now set up! Here's how to get it running:

### 1. Create Environment File
Copy the example environment file:
```bash
copy env.example .env
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if not already done)
```bash
# Install server dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system. If you don't have it installed:
- Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

```

This will start both the backend (port 5000) and frontend (port 3000) servers.

### 5. Test the Setup
